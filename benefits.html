			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<img src="images/benefits1.jpg" alt="Green plants" style="width:300px;height:400px">
			<p>The benefits of smart home technology are too great to ignore and in time every home will be integrated with this technology. When one considers the benefits that we stand to gain these decisions seem to be obvious investments that we should be making. While there are already many ways to improve lives, there are countless ways we have not considered yet and the benefits will only grow in the future.</p>
			<h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
			<p>Smart home technology can have a huge impact on the energy consumption of a home. Cooling is often considered the largest usage of energy and the ability to save even a quarter of that energy would make immense differences on a global scale. This improvement is relatively easy to achieve given the time people spend outside of their home and by maximizing temperature control in relevant rooms while reducing it in less used parts of the home.</p>
			<p>Lighting and standby energy consumption are also immense uses of energy which can be reduced even further. Depending on an individuals diligence in these concerns, energy consumption can be cut in half. Simply by disconnecting power to that which is not being used can improve efficiency to the point of a dramatic difference.</p>
