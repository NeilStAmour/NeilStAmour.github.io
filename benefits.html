			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<img src="images/benefits1.jpg" alt="Green plants" style="width:300px;height:400px">
			<p>The benefits of smart home technology are too great to ignore and in time every home will be integrated with this technology. When one considers the benefits that we stand to gain these decisions seem to be obvious investments that we should be making. While there are already many ways to improve lives, there are countless ways we have not considered yet and the benefits will only grow in the future.</p>
			<h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
			<p>Smart home technology can have a huge impact on the energy consumption of a home. Cooling is often considered the largest usage of energy and the ability to save even a quarter of that energy would make immense differences on a global scale. This improvement is relatively easy to achieve given the time people spend outside of their home and by maximizing temperature control in relevant rooms while reducing it in less used parts of the home.</p>
			<p>Lighting and standby energy consumption are also immense uses of energy which can be reduced even further. Depending on an individuals diligence in these concerns, energy consumption can be cut in half. Simply by disconnecting power to that which is not being used can improve efficiency to the point of a dramatic difference.</p>
			<h3>Monetary Investments</h3>
			<p>Any energy savings that we make can be converted directly to a monetary savings so all of these changes will be rather effective investments. With a relatively small cost which is becoming more affordable with each passing year, individuals can spend significantly less money on their home every month.</p>
			<p>At the moment this technology is becoming more common in newer homes in developed countries but it is relatively cheap to incorporate this technology in existing homes. If any individual feels they are in a position where they are building a home they will live in for any length of time it would only make sense to seek out obvious investments such as smart home technology. If you add a little efficiency early on the benefits will add up significantly.</p>
			<h3>Time Savings</h3>
			<p>The time that you can save once this technology is in place may not seem important, but over time the convenience it adds will be incredibly helpful in your busy life. These tools will eliminate the extremely common requirement to use light switches and modify the temperature controls in the vast majority of situations. As with all other changes, a little investment of time and money will go a long way in the future.</p>
			<h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
			<p>While society is using more renewable energy sources than the before there are still a great amount of fossil fuels being burned and any reduction in energy usage will mean that there is less demand for these fuels. As demand decreases it will be less profitable to undergo certain operations to extract these resources. In short, the less energy that an individual uses, the less damage will be done to the environment to obtain the resources necessary to produce that energy.</p>
