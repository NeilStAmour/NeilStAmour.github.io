			<h1>Who I Am</h1>
			<p>I'm a developer, creating things is my passion and that takes many different forms. Developing software, creating art, making games, and cooking are all ways which I add value to the world. Outside of that I like science fiction, video games, and dark beers in the fall.</p>

			<h1>What I Do</h1>
			<p>As I am sure you have figured out; I design, develop, and document software; but I do much more than that. I practice archery wherever I find the space, I swim whenever I have the time, and I explore the world around me when I have both.</p>
			<hr><br>
			<h1>Why Me</h1>
			<p>I adapt quickly to new roles which are not limited in scope to programming. I thrive when I have the opportunity to build a relationship with those both within and without the project I am working on. If you need someone who can interact closely with others, creating efficient and effective code, while adapting to changing needs, I would love to hear about the opportunity.</p>
