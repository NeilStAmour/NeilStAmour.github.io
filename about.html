				<h1>Who I Am</h1>
				<p>Iâ€™m a developer, creating things is my passion and that takes many
					different forms. Developing software, creating art, making games, and
					cooking are all ways which I add value to the world. In my spare time
					I enjoy science fiction, video games, and travel.</p>
				<hr><br>
				<h1>What I Do</h1>
				<p>As I am sure you have figured out; I design, develop, and document
					software; but I do much more than that. I have practiced archery
					nearly my entire life and I like to swim as my choice of exercise. I
					involve myself in every community I enter in to, doing what I can to
					make everyday life better but especially to build connections
					throughout the community.</p>
				<hr><br>
				<h1>Why Me</h1>
				<p>I adapt quickly to new roles which are not limited in scope to
					programming. I thrive when I have the opportunity to build a
					relationship with those both within and without the project I am
					working on. If you need someone who can interact closely with others,
					creating efficient and effective code, while adapting to changing
					needs, I would love to hear about the opportunity.</p>
