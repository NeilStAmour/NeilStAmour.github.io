			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>As our society develops more advanced and affordable technology our ability to integrate this technology in to our everyday lives is increasing at an incredible rate. This technology will be present in all aspects of modern society including our cities, on tools, and especially our homes. This site will serve as an introduction to this technology and it's place in the home.</p>
			<p>The benefits of this technology are currently limited by only our creativity in implementing the tools that we have. With the intelligent use of this technology we will save energy, provide convenience, and save everyone precious time. In the future we will take these benefits for granted as we move more freely and quickly through the world with less impact on the environment supporting us.</p>
			<p>The changes that need to be made to gain these benefits are currently underway. There are many companies that are building these Smart Homes as the first in their community. These homes will have the technology built in to the very structure of the home. There is also change underway where individuals are incorporating new tools into older homes. There is a path for change available for all individuals.</p>
			<p>As technology becomes more ubiquitous in our lives we are gaining the ability to create a real world connection between these objects. This is sometimes referred to as the <q>Internet of Things</q>. This means that all these connected tools and devices will be able to see each other and create important connections between each other. This provides the basis for reactionary events in the home.</p>
			<p>The energy that one can save by implementing this technology can be an incredible amount. Depending on the user's patterns this can cut energy consumption in half or even more. This will in turn save the homeowner's money as well as reducing their ecological impact. If done in the correct way the user will not even have to sacrifice any convenience for these benefits.</p>
