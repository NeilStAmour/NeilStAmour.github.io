				<h1>Experience</h1>
				<h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
				<h5>Smart Home Management 2015-2015</h5>
				<p>During my final year of university I took on a project to teach myself some skills which I had felt my
					education had not provided. This project was a website which would be used by those interested in
					home automation technology. Benefits would be calculated for an individual based on research and recent
					trends within Ontario. The entire project was designed, developed, documented, and tested by myself.	</p>
				<h6>Events Coordinator</h6>
				<h5>Guelph Secular Humanist Society   2012-2014</h5>
				<p>For three years of my university career I was the events coordinator of a non profit organization which
				promoted science literacy, freedom of expression, and community. During my time with this organization I
				began many initiatives which redirected efforts, improved public outreach, increased membership, and raised
				money for various causes. This position has provided me with an immense amount of leadership and teamwork
				experience which I have continued to use in each community I enter.
					</p>
				<h6>Front End Developer</h6>
				<h5>Farm-to-Fork   2012-2013</h5>
				<p>While I worked on Farm-To-Fork I was part of a small team which was working on the front end of the
				software which was working alongside five other teams working on different parts of the same project. I
				primarily worked with html5 and css3 while working with the rest of the teams in the design process. My
				team was responsible for the final appearance of the first version of the software and our design
				decisions have carried on to the current version.
