			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<p>By using real world situations that many people face on a daily basis I will illustrate the changes that smart home technology can make for the user. Some of these situations will likely work best for particular lives rather than others however there will always be improvements that one can make using this technology. We are limited by our imagination in adapting the technology we currently have at hand.</p>

			<h3>Basement Temperature</h3>
			<p>For many individuals and families the basement is a place where you rarely ever spend time. The basement is for storage, laundry, and sometimes a freezer, and as such you are usually only in that section of the house to retrieve or deposit something. Due to this it will likely be wasteful of any energy that goes into heating or cooling the basement. The smart home can learn about other such rooms where people rarely spend time and modify the temperature control to save energy where it is not appreciated. The end result is a significant saving on energy consumption while sacrificing a small amount of comfort for less than 0.1% of your day.</p>
			<h3>Scheduled Activity</h3>
			<p>Most of us live a life of schedules where we attend work on particular days and regularly go to particular events. While the technology in our home will not know what we are about to do it can make predictions based on the patterns of our life. If we leave everyday at 8:30 in the morning for work then our home may expect us to be gone for the eight hours that is normal. While we are gone heating/cooling can be reduced and certain utilities can be shut down to reduce standby power consumption. The more scheduled your life is, the more effective this type of solution will be. The only downside is when you break from your schedule your home may not be as you are accustomed to.</p>
			<h3>Motion Tracking</h3>
			<p>Many of the solutions that smart home technology provides us with are reliant on tracking the user's movement and making predictions and models based around this information, however there are very simple improvements that can be made without further data. The simple fact that you may never need to touch a light switch in your own home is likely an attractive thought. By sensors knowing when you leave or enter a room, the house can activate and deactivate lighting accordingly. Forgetting a light on in the basement will no longer happen, struggling to find the light switch at night will no longer be a problem. There are countless more advanced uses for this motion as well. One may have a speaker system set up throughout their house which allows their choice of music or radio to follow them around as they do chores or move to another room. Televisions or monitors may turn themselves off when you leave the room and reactivate when you enter again. There are an immense number of solutions with no significant downsides.</p>
